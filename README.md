# Pier-zon

This is the repository containing the 2022/2023 project for the course "Tecnologie Informatiche per il Web" at Politecnico di Milano.

## Scope of the project

The aim of this project was to create an e-commerce website using [Java Enterprise Edition](https://www.oracle.com/it/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html) and [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/). Specifically, this version of the project was to be built using only pure HTML and CSS for the front-end, no JavaScript allowed.

The back-end was made with Java EE and the [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) web server and interfaced with a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database to retrieve information about items for sale and store order data.

Unfortunately, I could not publish the original repository, since it contained sensitive information about the server hosting my database. However, everything here is the same as the original version, excluding the IPs and credentials.
